# Tyler's Training Log
An attempt at documenting all the weights lifted using [Traindown](https://github.com/scottt2/traindown) session markup language.

I historically have been terrible at recording my training. I typical will do well for a few weeks then forget. As of 2020, I have been training hard consistently for 17 years. I have recorded *maybe* 5% of that time. This repo is my best shot at correcting this going forward.

The hope is eventually a bunch of people use Traindown to record training like this and we can use all that data to build out rad plans in the future. Let's do it!

**Note on syntax**

2020 is on the latest Traindown syntax.

**TODO**
- [ ] update 2019 to latest syntax

If you have any questions or just want to chat, shoot me an email (in my profile).

Enjoy!
