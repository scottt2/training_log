# Tyler's Training Log
An attempt at documenting all the weights lifted using [Traindown](https://github.com/scottt2/traindown) session markup language.

I historically have been terrible at recording my training. I typical will do well for a few weeks then forget. As of 2020, I have been training hard consistently for 17 years. I have recorded *maybe* 5% of that time. This repo is my best shot at correcting this going forward.

Enjoy!
